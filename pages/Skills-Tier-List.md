# Armor Skills Tier List

Because everyone loves a tier list.

No tiermaker here, because Tri doesn't have iconography for its skills :(

Usual warnings apply. This tier list is done sort of without context. There will often be a situational reason for wanting a skill that would otherwise not be useful in a majority of cases.

Here we go!

## S Tier
Basically universally great skills.

### Sharpness+1 (Handicraft)
Basically mandatory for the majority of endgame blademaster weapons.

### Earplugs, High Grade Earplugs
Bring the correct earplugs for the occasion, *please*. There is no reason to bring HGE to everything.

### Trapmaster
A tie for best C-skill in the game. Easily gemmed in, or found on common talismans.

### Speed Sharpener
A tie for best C-skill in the game. Easily gemmed in.

### Adrenaline+2
This one is tough. It's either bottom S tier or top A tier I think. But it also requires a certain standard of play to execute.

### Element Atk Up (Gunner), Bonus Shot, Pierce S Boost, Pierce S All Up, Clust S All Up, Normal S All Up, Normal S Boost
Basically, pick the type of ammo you want to shoot and apply these skills. Indispensible.

## A Tier
### Attack Up
A for Attack. Duh. This is the blademaster and elemental gunning attack buff that you want.

### Critical Eye
A for Expert. Duh. This is the normal and pierce gunning attack buff that you want.

### Element Atk Up (Blademaster)
In my opinion, this skill is for elemental gunning, mostly. The cost of getting this skill is very very high, so I do not actually recommend it for blademasters. But if you like it on your SnS or Lance, go for it. I'll still put it in A tier cuz it does damage, I guess.

### Evasion
A lot of people will put this higher. I think it depends... but it's sort of universal so I'll give it a generic ranking instead of putting it in Uncategorizable/Situational. When it is good, it is *very* good.

### Guard
Same as evasion.

## B Tier
### Status Atk Up
Useless for stat gunners. Kind of useful for blades, but I think you can do fine without it. The real question is: will it actually break a threshold for you and actually get a meaningful +1 status effect?

### Negate Stun
This comes on Great Jaggi, which is a lot of people's first set. It prevents things like Gobul flashes, and can save you from trouble if you are being comboed. Of course, better not to be stunned in the first place, but nobody's perfect.

### Dung Bomb Expert
If you're tired of being trolled by Double Trouble, try this one out. Seriously.

### Combination Pro (Combo Plus)
This is actually important for pierce if you're solo gunning/carrying the team by doing all the damage.

### Item Use Up
Quality of life skill for those who pill-seed.

### Razor Sharp
Once you realize that Speed Sharpen is both better *and* easier to gem in, this skill loses a lot of its appeal.


## C Tier
These skills are just absolute filler. Entirely skippable.

### Health, Rec Speed, Defense
### Heat Cancel, Cold Cancel
### Poison
### Paralysis
### Water Res, Thunder Res, Ice Res, Dragon Res
### Windproof, Current Res
To be honest, I kind of like these skills. The main problem is that the opportunity cost of using them is too high.
### Mud/Snow, Blightproof

...the list goes on. I decided not to type it all out.

## Uncategorizable/Situational
### Fortify
Look, either you're doing solo speedruns or you're not.

### Negate Sleep, Flame Aura
**Bring this to Great Baggi. Seriously. Thank me later.**

### Critical Draw, FastCharge, Tremor-Proof
The Greatsword set of skills. Greatsword armor sets are all about matchups.

### Whim, Gathering, Speed Gather, Pro Transporter
Egg and gather quests. If you're impatient like me, they're mandatory when you go on those types.

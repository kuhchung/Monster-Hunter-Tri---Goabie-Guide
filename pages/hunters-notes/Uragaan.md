Monster Type : Brute Wyvern   
Threat Level : ★★★★★   
*Brute wyverns that feed on ore, using their mighty jaws to crush bedrock to powder.  They cleverly affix rocks and ore to their hides with lava, then cast them about, using vibrations to make them explode.  Will sometimes drop ore.*

Rage Tells: Speedup, black smoke from nose

## Preparations
Bring flash bombs and pitfall traps (but you should always have traps.)

In low rank, there are poison knives in the supply box. I love them :)

Its roar is standard grade and fairly wide range.

## Trapping
Pit into flash
  * If you load 10 pierce 1, when Uragaan is pitted and unraged, you can unload 20 shots before sheathing and flash bombing his roar. If raged, you can get 15.

If Uragaan is asleep, place your trap at/in front of its chin (test this more, TODO: picture).

## Avoidance and Evasion
If you're having trouble avoiding his crazy rolls, here's a tip: He will _never_ roll across the point where he initially started it!

Speaking of his crazy rolls, he has an annoying long roll in Area 6 that cannot be stopped if he chooses to do it. You can avoid it completely just by waiting near either of the exits. 

On his rock bomb throw, there is a safe point right in the middle of the circle outlined by his body. Even a non-focus GS has the timing to unleash a level 3 charge into the gut here.

Just like Agnaktor, his quad chin pound is considered a single attack. If you are guard lancing, smash right through it and attack through his animation!

The hurtbox of the quad chin pound is actually very small in front.

No evasion required to dodge his roar.

His bombs take time to detonate if left alone. Just... just don't be near them, especially if you're in adrenaline. Don't ask me how I know.

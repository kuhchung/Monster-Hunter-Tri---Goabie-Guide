# The Land of (Scatter)Fish and Honey

Monster Hunter Tri is a hard game, and especially so if you've never played a Monster Hunter game before. It was my first, and almost every new boss, I had trouble facing.

In addition to that, resources and zenny are fairly scarce, and materials are a lot stingier than in later iterations of the game.

I wanted to talk about how to get started in the early game to ease the journey.


## Playing Moga Village Content

I know everyone's excited to play online, but I personally always like to start my journey in offline mode. Moga has one exclusive monster (Ceadeus) that you will need in the end, and two very important resources in the game can only be farmed efficiently here. So here we go!

> Deserted Island Area 7
> Always collect spider webs.
> Spider webs make nets, which can be duped, but grabbing 2-3 every time you're going through area 7 of Deserted Island really adds up. I always gather the bug node that yields these spider webs or insect husks (boo.)
> You can also trade for spider webs at the trading post in Loc Lac, but that requires a different annoying sidequest: carving bugs and ants for monster fluid. I prefer just whipping out the bug net.

TODO: Picture of webs

> Collect dung when convenient
> If you're in area 8 (for example, capturing a Rathian), after the hunt is over, grab some dung from the poop pile. Dung is useful!

When you need resources or want to freehunt for the joy of it, grab more spider webs on every trip. I like to freehunt when the latest monster shows up in the forest, when it's herbivores breeding (Super Dung can only be gotten via freehunt this way), or when it's Abundant Commodities.

Capturing a boss monster yields some extra resources, but it may not be worth the resources and effort. Seriously! Even traps and tranqs can be a little annoying to come by.

Progress through the game fulfilling Junior's sidequests. When the Argosy Captain arrives, trade your rare commodities to upgrade the Fishing Fleet so that you unlock the location Moga Shallows.

> Sandy Plains Area 1
> White bug spots can spawn in this area. If they do, gather them!
> They always fetch with thunderbugs (yay!) and gluehoppers (probably yay!)

TODO: Picture

Make sure to pay a little zenny to eat a meal before you go on quests. If you get Crazy Lucky Cat, take the hunt with the highest Zenny reward! This is always going to be a capture quest. I did a lot of Qurupeco, Ludroth, and Rathian capturing as I continued to rank up in village.

Once you hit 4* Moga Village quests, you unlock the Tundra. Make sure to grab some Stormsender seeds on your first journey. You will grow these on your farm to sell for Zenny.

> Make sure your combine rate is 100%! The last thing you want is to waste your items by creating garbage.
> Combo Plus may be very useful as well. Sap Plant and Iron Ore makes 2 Bomb Casings.
> Buy a copy of Combo Book 1 and 2 from the Gal with the Goods. 
> If you're just in your room making hunt supplies, putting on full Chainmail can be a big help.

## The Moga Mogul Empire

At about this point, you should have some farms upgraded all the way (10 days) and probably 2 boats with access to Moga Shallows, as well as some commodities under your belt to trade. Here is what I do:

- Set the Argosy Captain to visit only the farming location for the shortest journey.
- When Fish Finder is on discount, trade all my common commodities to stockpile them! Even better if something of ours sells for extra value.
- Plant Stormsender seeds with dung
- Send your boats to Moga Shallows and use Fish Finder

The Stormsender seeds, you can just hit sell all to make a nice chunk of change - about 22,000 (TODO: double check, screenshot) zenny every cycle. Stormsenders aren't the highest selling item you can farm, but the resource to zenny efficiency can't be beat.

And to replenish resources without free hunting, collect all of the fish that your ships get from Moga Shallows, visit Junior, and generate resources out of all of them besides scatterfish. Scatterfish are priceless. Hang onto them!

Now you should have regular zenny and resource income flowing in.
 
> The Argosy Captain also has other useful things for trade. Discounted thunderbugs are very nice, especially when there's a buff on armorfish morsels. Whenever a nice consumable goes on sale, I consider trading for a bunch of them. Dash Juice, Pitfall Trap, Flash Bomb... stuff like that.

Now that you aren't constantly going broke forging armors and weapons, it might be time to switch up the farm! The following items are very nice to have plenty of. I'm talking hundreds, maybe a little over a thousand.

- Honey. Honey honey honey. Put these on 10 cycles with Bizzy Bees. Trade for Bizzy Bees. FARM HONEY.
- Flashbugs (FLASH BOMBS!)
- Godbugs (ingredient for Max Potion)
- Might Seed 
- Dragon Toadstool 

## Cycling your days
Once your farm and fish empire is running, *always* sleep at night. This allows your boats and farm to advance another half day, accelerating their output.

In order to advance from day to night, you have to either freehunt or go on a quest that takes at least five minutes (TODO: test or get a source on this.) If you go to freehunt, grab spider webs (area 7), grill some rare or well done steaks (up to you), grab some dung, and return to Moga Village. If it didn't turn to nighttime, go back out and spend a little longer.

## Welcome to the city! We have markets!
Welcome to Loc Lac! Did you show up in a Helios mix, proving to other hunters that you completed Moga Village and are kitted out with the best equipment Low Rank has to offer? Ah, well, no matter.

The city sells a variety of items that you would otherwise have to combine on your own in Moga. Have you noticed how annoying it is to make Bomb Casings? Well, Todd sells them to you! ...sometimes. 

> Jhen Mohran threatens the very existence of Loc Lac every two weeks. The markets are expanded, and everything sells for half price! Thunderbugs! Pin Tuna! Bird Wyvern Fang! BUY BUY BUY!

Make sure to shop and stock up when Jhen arrives. Chamberlyne, read me my shopping list.

Nya!
- Gunpowder
- Thunderbugs
- Bomb Casings
- Bird Wyvern Fang (Pierce 1 combine)
- Pin Tuna (Pierce 2 combine)
- Wyvern Claw (Lifepowder and Clust2 combine)
- Dragon Toadstool (Immunizer combine)


Now all you have to do is go on hunts and not triple cart. Hmm, where did I leave my Felyne Moxie again...

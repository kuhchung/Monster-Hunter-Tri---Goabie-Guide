## Talismans
> How do I get \<insert talisman here>? What charm table am I on?  
Charm tables exist, but it is opaque and irrelevant to the player. Every time you start up the game, you will land on a random charm table, so don't worry; you're not locked in.

> How do I farm charms?  
#### Low Rank
I like Moga Village's Wyvern Conservation. Note that you have to be pretty desperate to farm these, in my opinion, since they're only low rank talismans. If you play exclusively offline, then you'll probably be at this for a while. 

Do this with Felyne Lander to save a ton of time.

#### High Rank
You can Roll the Uroktor and go mining. If you're lucky, you'll come away with a few Timeworn Charms.

The event quest World Eater drops a lot of Timeworn Charms. People used to speedrun this in the past to do specifically that.  

>> World Eater is *the* reason to get into gunning, if you haven't already tried it yet.

Otherwise, just keep doing high level hunt quests and pray.

## Loc Lac
> I did my urgent, but I don't see the next rank of quests in Loc Lac! Why?  
You need to complete your key quests, your urgent quest, **and** be high enough rank to unlock the next tier.

Breakpoints are:  
0-8  
9-18  
19-30  
31-40  
41-50  
51+  

> Why isn't \<insert quest> available? I'm on the correct tier.  
Loc Lac randomizes the quest selection list. Go on a quest and check again next time.

## Moga
> When do I unlock Switch Axe? When do I unlock Longsword?  
Switch Axe - around Barroth time.  
Longsword - when Argosy returns after you beat Barroth.

> Where did Cha-Cha disappear?  
Cha-Cha leaves after your first Lagiacrus kill mission. He will return after you do 2 of the 3 new quests available to you (Roll the Uroktor, Powderstone Burns, Lord of the Seas.)

> I did all the missions in Moga but I can't seem to progress...  
Talk to Junior, complete the Villager Request to repair the Ancient Mask, and make sure you grab it from behind the waterfall at the farm.

> How do I get resources vs go on quests?  
To go on a quest, you must take a mission from Guildie and depart on the canoe (left side of Moga Village.)  
To freehunt, go out the right (up the steps and over the wooden bridge.)

## Forge
> Why isn't \<insert weapon or armor> on my forge list at the blacksmith even though I beat the monster?  
To unlock the piece of gear you want to see fro mthe blacksmith, you must have the first material on the list required for the forge. This means if you haven't seen it, you're missing a material.

> What's the difference between overforging and making the armor+?  
TODO: pic  
A monster's high rank armor (denoted by +) may have completely different armor skills from its low rank counterpart. It is a completely distinct piece of armor.

If you want to continue using your low rank armor set but update its defensive values for high rank (**overforge**), you can choose Upgrade Armor at the smith, select your low rank armor, and then perform a "special" upgrade that requires high rank materials. This will bring it in line with high rank defense, but retain its original skills.

> Is there a high rank Ceadeus set? How can there be if there's no Ceadeus in Loc Lac?  
Ceadeus+ (Helios for male, Selene for female) armor requires low rank Ceadeus materials and high rank Lagiacrus materials.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I get \<insert talisman here>? What charm table am I on?
Charm tables exist, but it is opaque and irrelevant to the player. Every time you start up the game, you will land on a random charm table, so don't worry; you're not locked in.

## How do I farm charms?
### Low Rank
I like Moga Village's Wyvern Conservation. Note that you have to be pretty desperate to farm these, in my opinion, since they're only low rank talismans. If you play exclusively offline, then you'll probably be at this for a while. 

Do this with Felyne Lander to save a ton of time.

### High Rank
You can Roll the Uroktor and go mining. If you're lucky, you'll come away with a few Timeworn Charms.

The event quest World Eater drops a lot of Timeworn Charms. People used to speedrun this in the past to do specifically that.  
> World Eater is *the* reason to get into gunning, if you haven't already tried it yet.

Otherwise, just keep doing high level hunt quests and pray.

## I did my urgent, but I don't see the next rank of quests in Loc Lac! Why?
You need to complete your key quests, your urgent quest, **and** be high enough rank to unlock the next tier.

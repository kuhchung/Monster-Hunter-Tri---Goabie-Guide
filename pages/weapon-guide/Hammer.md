# Hammer

## IMPORTANT MECHANIC CHANGES
Well, more like, hammer was changed post-Tri. As early as 3U. Tri hammer is a lot, *lot* different if you're coming from later titles.

In later titles, every touch on the head with the hammer dealt KO damage. And as far as I know (could easily be wrong, I'm going off vague memory but the conclusion is the same), KO touches dealt a set amount of KO. It didn't matter if you were upswinging, spin spamming at the head, or hitting with a superpound - every touch did the same KO damage.

BUT NOT HERE.

In Tri, **not every hammer attack** deals KO damage! And what's more, KO damage depends 1) on the particular attack you're executing, and 2) is multiplied through by sharpness.

**The superpound and the golfswing deal massive KO damage compared to every other hammer attack.**

Do not waste time spinning the monster. Do not waste time finding little upswing hits.

Triple pound, super pound, or golfswing the head.

## Hammer loop
Barring monsters with problematic heads, I would say that superpounds comprise 90% of your attacks. The remaining 10% will just be random attacks of opportunity that you can sneak in.

## Damage Optimization
You've scored a KO! Great! Now **stop charging superpounds** and go for triple pounds! If you were mid charge, just roll out of it!! You'll deal more damage and be less disruptive.

For many winged monsters, they will stagger over with a wing side up and wing side down. Perform your triple from the wing side down. Otherwise, you will bounce on the wing.

Do not flow from the golfswing into a charge. Just wait for the golfswing animation to end, perform your second triple, then cancel that one into charge to prepare for free movement again.

## Non-Disruption
If you score a knockout and a greedy Greatsword (like me) arrives to smash the head, hopefully their positioning is good so that your golfswing won't launch them.

However, if the jerk is in your way...

I just let it be. The hammer flow is actually fairly flexible. Instead of double triple, I have done downswing 1, downswing 2, charge slap, upswing, downswing 1, downswing 2...

Improvise!

## Knockout Thresholds
A superpound with purple sharpness deals 72 KO damage. Barioth's KO threshold, for example, is 150. Thus, 2 superpounds and change achieve KO.

For the raths, it is 3 superpounds.

Alatreon is 2/4/5/7/9.

Once you've played enough, you'll have an innate feeling for when a KO is coming soon.

And once you've played even more, you'll have a sense of how ready a monster is to capture based on how many knockouts you've scored.

TODO: Port these values over from other sources.

## Strategic Knockouts
When I am playing with skilled hunters, if I spawn in with the monster ahead of everyone else, I will hit the head enough such that my next superpound (or whatever) will knockout. Then, I will wait for my teammates to arrive before scoring the knockout. In my opinion, it is selfish and a waste to score a knockout solo.

If a monster is trapped, in my opinion, you should not knock it out. It will break shock trap duration, and it feels wasted if the monster is pitted. Most pitted monsters can be flashed and the team can continue to put damage on it. Then, when it recovers, deal the knockout blow to continue the stun loop.

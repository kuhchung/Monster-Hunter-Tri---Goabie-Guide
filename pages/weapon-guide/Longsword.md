## Tri Longsword Mechanics
Tri famously has the spirit gauge that does not deplete once it is full. That's right, as long as you've filled up the spirit gauge, you can press R to perform the spirit combo without ever draining meter.

This is fine.

## DON'T MASH!
Yes, this is directed at you. Don't mash R just because you can.

The 3rd move of the spirit combo - the 3 hit step - is an enormous commitment. You require an opening or a read to go into this. If you do go into the 3 step, you are likely committing to the finishing roundslash as well.

I am happy to trade hits with the monster if it means climbing the spirit color gauge, or refreshing red, but not otherwise. I am *very* unhappy if I trade with the monster during the 3 hit.

## Fade and Roll
Longsword's most important attack is the fade slash. Press X+A while holding left or right to simultaneously attack and make a *massive* move off the centerline to the left or the right, respectively. Wiimote users can even perform a left/right fade slash from a neutral standstill.

The fade slash is for positioning. If the monster is attacking and your fade will not get you out of the way, you either needed to fade earlier, or you now need to roll to get out of trouble. You'll learn which from experience.

## The Longsword Loop - Extend!
During a monster's free movement, most longsword engagements will be one or two quick hits followed by a fade or roll out.

We only get two steps of the spirit combo before the committal 3 step, but we can extend the first two hits. Perform spirit 1, X, spirit 2, X, for up to a prudent 4 hits that you can roll or fade at any point. Or start with A, or open with X if you're trying to swing high for a tail or something, then fade away. This is your bread and butter.

## Damage Optimization
Against monsters that are disabled, and assuming you are red, your best damage is actually not to complete the finishing roundslash! The following combo maximizes your damage:

Spirit 1, X, Spirit 2, X, Spirit 3, fade, A, then return to Spirit 1.

You want to perform the finisher when the monster is entering free movement again.

## Trust yourself
It is tempting to try to get the roundlsash all the time. What if we lose red and go all the way back down to no spirit color?!

If you take a bunch of hits in the process of mashing to maintain red, you will do less overall damage, and likely will have missed out on proper openings to maintain your spirit color. Trust in your own skill, do not trade, and wait for the proper opening. You have longer than you think.

If you lose red, whatever, Just build it up again. It happens, especially if the monster is zoning, or Agnaktor is trolling.

## Overview

Bowgun may seem intimidating, but you can just use the guns I've assembled and play around with it before deciding if you want to experiment with your own gun combinations. The below will just cover the basics of dealing damage with shot types.

> Just point and shoot at the monster. It's not that hard!

For your intro to gunning, I recommend trying out both elemental and pierce.

Bowguns are *not* long range weapons! I would describe them as medium range.

## Elemental
Fire shots deal one hit. Water, Thunder, and Ice shots deal 3 hits and pierce, for whatever reason.

Besides Element Atk Up, elemental shots want Attack Up X armor skills. At the very endgame, Bonus Shot is also extremely desirable.

Elemental shots are very sensitive to hitzones. Aim well!

## Pierce
Pierce shots perform 3, 4, or 5 hits for Pierce 1, 2, and 3 respectively. After the bullet hits once, it will continue on its trajectory, dealing its subsequent hits.

Pierce 3 is almost never worthwhile.

Because of the multi-hit aspect, pierce bowguns often want range compression. This makes the subsequent hits closer, dealing more damage to better hitzones and avoiding missing the tail end of the hits entirely.

The weapon has a sweet zone. If the shot hits with a big white flash, then you are dealing extra damage. Learn the range for this based on your gun, and always try to fire for this bonus damage.

## Normal
Normal 3 sucks ass. Garbage.

Normal 2 is... fine. The range to get a white flash is less sensitive than pierce.


## Clust
You want all the bomblets to land. This is mostly used to farm Alatreon in full clust groups. For the big black pony, wait for him to get his horns stuck in the wall, then fire onto the center of his back to help ensure that all bomblets hit.

This shit is a science, man.

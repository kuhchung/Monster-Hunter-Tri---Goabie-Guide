## Your one takeaway
If there's only one thing you read and retain from this page, let it be this.

ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ **DON'T LANCE CHARGE.** ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ

Lance charge is shit for damage and disrupts teammates. When you press lance charge, it's lighting the beacon to all your teammates screaming "I am a noob!"

Okay fine there are reasons to lance charge, but if you knew that, then you don't need this page, do you?

## Why not lance charge?
I will quote the damage formula FAQ directly.

> Also note that status ailments are reduced by half when using the lance charge.  
> A status hit (stun) that would normally deal 20 stun damage will only deal 10.  
> Elements are reduced by 75%.  8 elemental damage per hit would be reduced to 2 per hit when charging with the lance.

And as for raw, each tick deals slightly less damage than a poke. So you are grinding down your weapon's sharpness, dealing significantly less elemental damage, dealing significantly less status damage, and potentially bowling over your teammates.

Great.

Please, just triple poke the monster.

> On land, lance charge isn't even faster than running. But it *is* funny.

## Mobility
If the monster is far away, sheathe and move.

If the monster is within two backhops, backhop toward it! It's super slick and fast.

## Damage Optimization
Since we know not to lance charge now, your damage optimization is simply to perform three pokes, counter or hop, then continue three pokes.

The upstab (A) is stronger than the forward stab (X) for the first two pokes. The third poke is equivalent on both. But don't pay attention to that too much. More important is using the correct button for your positioning, and striking the correct hitzone.

## Evade
In Tri, your default evade (B) has 2 frames of invincibility. This is enough for monster tailwhips, but the timing is tight. Other things are possible to evade as well, such as Rathalos flying toward you (roll forward thru him), Diablos's forward rushes (positioning dependent, sidehop), etc.

Evasion+1 gives you a total of 8 (!) frames of invincibility. This can absolutely break and dominate certain monsters.

Evasion+2 gives you a total of 10 frames of invinciblity. This is widely considered unnecessary (I agree.)

## Guard
Monster attacks have a certain block stun value. Certain attacks are heavier than others. Some, you can counter quickly with an upstab. Otherwise, it takes a little longer and you get a forward stab. And the strongest ones simply put you in blockstun and don't let you counter at all, even if you were in a counter stance (you will still block though.)

I don't know if these have a technical term or even a playerbase widely accepted term, so I am simply calling them G0, G1, and G2.

G0 means that you can get the quick counter without a Guard skill.  
G1 means you can get the quick counter, but only if you have Guard+1. Think a long range Barroth charge or a Barioth jump swipe.  
G2 means you need Guard+2.  

> Early monsters like Jaggi, Qurupeco, and Ludroth's attacks are majority G0. Surprisingly, Diablos's roar is also G0, despite an incredibly long stun duration if she hits you with it. Go figure.
> Most monster roars are G1.
> Ceadeus's roar is G2.

## Guard Boost
Not to be confused with Guard, this armor skill lets you block previously unblockable attacks. Gigginox's poison flop, Alatreon's fireball, and Lagiacrus's large lightning field all come to mind.

If you want to shell up and be able to Guard anything, this is your skill.

## Evade vs Guard
When I played, there was a prevalent opinion that evade was better than guard. I think this is bupkus. I believe that it is simply matchup dependent.

For example, Uragaan and Agnaktor have quadruple face slams into the ground. The game considers these one attack. If you guard lance this, you can chunk through the first slam of their attacks, and then simply *be inside their body* and *completely immune to the following three attacks.* What does evasion give you? (Nothing.)

But vs Deviljho and Diablos, evasion lets you comfortably dodge while maintaining close position and uninterrupted stabbing. You won't get that with Guard.

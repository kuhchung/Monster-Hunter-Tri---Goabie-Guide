# The Armory

Welcome to my armory! This is a compilation of useful loadouts that I either discovered or was given. If you're looking for a functional set, look no further!

My goal for all of these sets is to *not* dictate what talismans you must use, whenever possible. Greatsword users, beware. You're gonna need a tali.

By the way, Helios and Selene are the male and female armor made of Ceadeus parts. Use whatever applies for your character's gender.

## General Melee Sets

### Endgame Standard Earplugs
Sharpness+1, Earplugs

Selene+ Helm - OOO  
Selene+ Mail  
Vangis Vambraces  
Selene+ Coil - OOO  
Selene+ Greaves  

Total: Handicraft15, Hearing10, Attack5

It seems natural to get to at least AuS, but the customization is entirely up to you. A common favorite loadout of mine is Sharpness+1, Earplugs, AuS, Trapmaster, Sharpener. That would require a SpeedSetup10 OO or comparable talisman.

---

### Endgame Standard Earplugs 2
Sharpness+1, Earplugs

Selene+ Helm - OOO  
Selene+ Mail  
Vangis Vambraces  
Selene Coil  
Vangis Greaves - OOO  

Total: Handicraft14, Hearing10, Attack6

Another way to achieve the same loadout as above. The Attack6 goes really well with a Queen talisman that has C+10 Atk+3 O.

---

### Endgame High Grade Earplugs
Sharpness+1, High Grade Earplugs

Selene+ Helm - OOO  
Selene+ Mail  
Selene+ Vambraces  
Selene Coil  
Vangis Greaves - OOO  

Total: Handicraft14, Hearing15, Attack1

This is *the* high grade earplugs loadout. If you want a headless one though...

---

### Endgame Scuffed High Grade Earplugs
Sharpness+1, High Grade Earplugs

None  
Selene+ Helm  
Selene+ Mail  
Selene Coil  
Selene+ Greaves  

Total: Handicraft15, Hearing17

You can swap the HR greaves for the LR greaves if you want.  

Truth is, there's a lot of ways to make less optimal versions of Sharpness+1 and some variety of earplugs. When I first reach HR51, these are the first sets I make by mixing whatever Vangis and Helios I have, and I improvise until I can refine them into Endgame Standard or Endgame HGE.

---

### Endgame Standard No Earplugs
Sharpness+1, Attack Up M, Autotracker

Vangis Helm  
Vangis Mail  
Vangis Vambraces  
Vangis Coil  
Vangis Greaves - OOO  

Total: Handicraft15, Psychic15, Attack15

Yes, this is just full Deviljho. Not many slots to work with. However, if you're willing to lose some Attack, you can get...

---

### Endgame Standard No Earplugs Flexible
Sharpness+1, Attack Up S, Detect

Vangis Helm  
Vangis Mail  
Vangis Vambraces  
Selene+ Coil - OOO  
Vangis Greaves - OOO  

Total: Handicraft14, Psychic12, Attack12

In my opinion, losing one level of attack is worth being able to gem in other stuff, like both sharpener and trapmaster just as an example. Also useful is guard, evasion, dung bomb expert, or whatever.  
If you're looking for an evade lancer set, this is it!

---

### Elemental Enjoyers
Sharpness+1, Element Atk Up, Attack Up X

Vangis Helm  
Lagiacrus+ Mail - OOO (element4)  
Vangis Vambraces  
Helios+ Coil - OOO (handicraft4)  
Vangis Greaves - OOO (element4)  

Total: Handicraft15, Element9, Attack9

I'd rather use a standard sharpness mix, but that's me. With a 2 slot weapon and attack god talisman (Attack7 OO), you can get AuL. Don't forget to finish off the Element9 and Attack9 by adding the corresponding decos either in your weapon or your talisman.

---

### Steel Guard Lancing
<p float="left">
<img src="images/steel-guard-lancing.png" width="48%">
<img src="images/steel-guard-lancing-skills.png" width="48%">
<p float="left">

Sharpness+1, Guard+1, Speed Sharpen

1 slot weapon - O (handicraft1)  
Vangis Helm  
Vangis Mail  
Steel+ Vambraces - O (sharpener2)  
Steel+ Coil - O (guard1)  
Vangis Greaves - OOO (handicraft4)  

Handicraft 14, Guard10, Sharpener10, Attack7

This is what I have for guard lancing that doesn't require a guard skill in the talisman. You need one more handicraft point in the tali. Funny enough, C+10 Atk+3 O fits extremely well into this set once more to tack on another C skill as well as AuS, but that is not at all mandatory. 

---

### Alloy is Bae
Critical Eye 2, Trapmaster, Sharpener

Alloy+ Helm - OO  
Alloy+ Mail - OO  
Alloy+ Vambraces - OO  
Alloy+ Coil - OO  
Alloy+ Greaves  

Total: Expert15, Sharpener10, SpeedSetup10

Useful for weapons that don't benefit much from Sharpness+1, such as Flame Tempest and Reaver "Calamity".  
Since Alloy+ already has the best C skills in the game, I just shove attack3 gems into everything, but obviously it's up to you.  
Notably, this is available as soon as you unlock HR31! It's a very good progression set.

---

## Greatsword Sets

Okay, these require critical draw talismans. I warned you!

### Endgame GS Standard
Sharpness+1, Earplugs, Critical Draw, Focus

Anguish P - O (handicraft1)  
Baggi+ Helm - OOO (fastcharge4)  
Selene+ Mail  
Diablos+ Vambraces - OOO (fastcharge4)  
Vangis Coil  
Selene+ Greaves  
Talisman - Crit Draw7 O or better

Total: Handicraft15, Critical Draw10, Focus10, Hearing10

If your critical draw talisman is only 7, you could use the very expensive and inferior Alatreon Revolution. If you don't have THAT, then you can use low rank Selene Greaves and not run earplugs.

If you have Crit Draw6 OO, you can do the following for higher defense...

---

### Endgame GS Standard Redux
Sharpness+1, Earplugs, Critical Draw, Focus

Anguish P - O (crit draw1)  
Selene+ Helm - OOO (fastcharge4)  
Selene+ Mail  
Hinata+ Kote - OOO (fastcharge4)  
Selene Coil  
Vangis Greaves - OOO (handicraft4)  
Talisman - Crit Draw6 OO (crit draw3)  

Total: Handicraft15, Critical Draw10, Focus10, Hearing10

Style! Note that this costs a stout horn for your decoration.

---

### Endgame GS Standard no earplugs
Sharpness+1, Critical Draw, Focus, C+10

Anguish P - O (handicraft1)  
Baggi+ Helm - OOO (fastcharge4)  
Selene+ Mail  
Diablos+ Vambraces - OOO (fastcharge4)  
Selene+ Coil - OOO (handicraft4)  
Vangis Greaves - OOO (crit draw3, handicraft1)  
Talisman: Crit Draw5/6, C+10

Total: Handicraft15, Critical Draw10, Focus10, C10

For when earplugs don't help. I've seen Item Use Up and Capture Guru as the most useful C skills in this set.

If your talisman is Crit Draw 6, then you don't have to blow a stout horn for the decoration.

---

### Punishing Meme
Sharpness+1, Critical Draw, Punishing Draw, Earplugs

Anguish P - O (hearing1)  
Damascus Helm - OOO (punishdraw4)  
Selene+ Mail  
Diablos+ Vambraces - OOO (punishdraw4)  
Vangis Coil  
Selene Greaves  
Talisman: Crit Draw7 O or better

Total: Handicraft15, Critical Draw10, Punishing Draw10, Hearing10

If you're into that sort of thing.

## Pierce Gunning

### Deviating Uragaan Smasher
Pierce Boost, Pierce S Lvl 1 Up, Critical Eye X

Thundacrus Rex - Barrozooka O - Thundacrus OO  
Diablos+ Cap  
Diablos+ Vest  
Diablos+ Guards - OOO  
Alloy+ Coat - OO  
Gobul+ Leggings - OOO

Total: PierceS Up10, Pierce S+10, Expert4

This gun loads 10 pierce1 rounds and fires at 0.6 range with high L deviation. The build above is prepared to gem in Critical Eye, the superior damage option for pierce shots. Otherwise, you can slot it however you like and use whatever talisman you want. If you want evasion, use Barioth+ Coat, Barioth Leggings, and an evasion talisman.

If you don't have/can't get a Stout Horn for the chest piece, the low rank Diablos Vest is only one point worse than the high rank one.

I've named this gun the Uragaan smasher because it obliterates the poor guy. In the Advanced quest Heroes Wanted, 60 Adrenaline Pierce 1 shots and probably some bombs will put one of them low enough to capture!

---

### Straight Shooters
Pierce Boost, Pierce S All Up, Critical Eye 2

Thundacrus Rex - Devil's Grin O (expert1) - Thundacrus Rex OO (PierceS+3)  
Diablos+ Cap  
Diablos+ Vest  
Diablos+ Guards - OOO (expert5)  
Alloy+ Coat - OO (PierceS+3)  
Gobul+ Leggings - OOO (expert5)  

Total: PierceS Up10, Pierce S+16, Expert15

This gun loads 8 pierce2 rounds and fires at 0.8 range with no deviation. Use whatever talisman you want. Like above, if you want evasion, swap the bottom pieces and use an appropriate talisman.

Also like above, substitue low rank chest if you need to.

This gun wants to fire straight through the longest part of the body. Fire straight into Deviljho or Agnaktor's face and thru the body, for example.

---

### World Eater Gun
The same as above, but change the gun parts to  
Chaos Wing - Devil's Grin O - Blizzard Cannon

Note that this gun has a folding frame so it is very immobile. It is used in World Eater speedruns, but can also be used freestyle in that fight. Its range is 0.96 so you can fire a little more comfortably vs the big guy, but whether or not it's better than just firing regular old 0.8 range bullets with a medium bowgun probably depends on the player.

For all of the above pierce gunning sets, the waist and leggings are up to you! For evasion, use Barioth+ Coat and Barioth- Leggings. For adrenaline, use Barroth+ Coat and Barroth+ Leggings, or when Black Leather Pants is in the game, use that.

---

## Normal and Elemental Gunning

### Normal Meme
Normal S Boost, Normal S All Up

Chaos Wing - Jhen Cannon O - Aquamatic "Needler" - O  or Vulcannon  
Agnaktor+ Cap  
Agnaktor+ Vest - O  
Agnaktor+ Guards - OOO  
Agnaktor+ Coat - OOO  
None  

Total: NormalS Up10, Normal S+10

Look, no pants!

Sorry, Normal shot is sort of a meme. It's kind of good vs Qurupeco.

---

### Elemental Rapid Fire Bonus Shot
Element Atk Up, Bonus Shot

Rathling+ Gun - Rathling+ Gun O - Rathling+ Gun OO  
None  
Lagiacrus+ Vest - OOO (element4)  
Escadora Arma - O (rapid fire1)  
Lagiacrus+ Coat - OO  
Lagiacrus+ Leggings - O  

Total: Rapid Fire10, Elemental10

For the head piece, you could wear Barrage Earring (meh), or any earring of your choice, or Barroth+ Helm/Cap and a potential talisman. Or whatever you want!

---


### Ghost Rider Rapid Fire Bonus Shot
Element Atk Up, Bonus Shot, Evasion Up

Chaos Wing - Rathling+ Gun O - Rathling+ Gun OO  
Skull Mask  
Lagiacrus+ Vest - OOO (element4)  
Escadora Arma - O (evade dist1)  
Escadora Force - OO (evade dist1, evade dist1)  
Escadora Scala - O (evade dist1)  

Total: Elemental10, Evade Dist15, Rapid Fire10

We get more raw on the gun, and Evasion Up is there to make up for the lack of mobility with the HBG. It's actually pretty fun.

The listed guns are for rapid firing fire shots. I find the other elemental shots bad/useless, but you can just switch the barrel and stock to find ones that load the ammo type you want.

---

### Deep Fried Alatreon
Load Up, Recoil Down 3, Clust S All Up

Rathling Gun+ - Rathling Gun+ O (clust S+1) - Agnablaster OO (recoil1, recoil1)  
Barrage Earring  
Amagi+ Muneate - O (recoil1)  
Uragaan+ Guards - OOO (recoil4)  
Uragaan+ Coat - O (recoil1)  
Amagi+ Hakama  
Talisman: Clust6 or better  

Total: Loading15, Clust S+15, Recoil20

Alatreon abuse gun, loading 5 clust2 and firing with no recoil. If you have Clust god (Clust S+7 OO), you can gem in bombardier too.

Honestly, there's probably a cheaper way to make this without requiring a clust6 talisman. The key takeaway is, this is the gun you *must* use, and the armor skills you are aiming for are Clust S All Up and Recoil Down 3. If you do not have Barrage Earring, that is fine. Look at the Uragaan+ and Jhen+ pieces, check your talismans, and try it out.

---

### Status Gunning
Use Thundacrus Rex - Jhen Cannon/Light Bowgun - Chaos Wing. Get Recoil Down+2, Trapmaster, and Bombardier. The rest is irrelevant. You don't need Load Up.  You don't need Status Atk Up.

Full Uragaan+ meets these requirements.

---

## Status Melee Sets

Note: These are very, very flexible. Mine are just some simple examples.

In my opinion, if you run paralyze, then trapmaster is mandatory.  
If you run sleep, bombardier is mandatory.

### Blast Earring, anyone?
Status Atk Up, Trapmaster, Razor Sharp

None  
Alloy+ Mail - OO (speedsetup2, sharpness1)  
Alloy+ Vambraces - OO (speedsetup2, speedsetup2)  
Bnahabra+ Coil - O (status1)  
Bnahabra+ Greaves - O (status1)  

Total: Sharpness10, Status10, SpeedSetup10

Plenty of room to add other skills of your choice.

---

### Blast Earring, anyone? Lance Remix
Status Atk Up, Razor Sharp, Guard+1

None  
Agnaktor+ Mail - O  
Steel+ Vambraces - O  
Bnahabra+ Coil - O  
Bnahabra- Boots  

Total: Sharpness9, Status10, Guard10

For people who like guard lancing. Note the Bnah boots are low rank!

---

### Who Needs Blast Earring?
<p float="left">
<img src="images/who-needs-blast-earring.png" width="48%">
<img src="images/who-needs-blast-earring-skills.png" width="48%">
<p float="left">
Status Atk Up, Razor Sharp, Bombardier

Morpheus Knife - OO  
Uragaan+ Helm - O (bombardier2)  
Uragaan+ Mail - O (sharpness1)  
Uragaan+ Vambraces - OOO  
Bnahabra+ Coil - O (status1)  
Bnahabra+ Greaves - O (status1)  

Bombardier8, Status10, Sharpness10

There are still five slots left in the armor, and I haven't even included a talisman here. Put in the bomb boost gem to make sure you reach Bombardier.

If you have Bomb Boost+5 SpeedSetup+10 tali, you can even leave off the Uragaan+ helm.

---

### Low Rank Lagi

<img src="images/low-rank-lagi-gunner.png" width="48%">
<img src="images/low-rank-lagi-gunner-skills.png" width="48%">
<p float="left">
Normal S Boost, Element Atk Up, Olympic Swimmer, Status Atk Down

Lagiacrus Cap - OO  
Lagiacrus Vest - O  
Lagiacrus Guards - OO  
Lagiacrus Coat - OO  
Lagiacrus Leggings - OO  

Low Rank elemental gunning goodness. Lagiacrus is so flexible.

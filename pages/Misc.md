# Miscellanea


These have been independently tested and confirmed.



## Sleep
If you wake a sleeping monster with a melee attack, the damage is doubled.  
If you wake a sleeping monster with a bomb, the damage is _tripled_.
    
## Hosting the monster
The first person to show up in the zone with the monster serves as the host. If you have a lot of lag, let someone else have the privilege of hosting.  
If two people spawn in the monster area at the same time, the tiebreak is done by who posted (player with red name.)
    
## Adamant Pill
This thing prevents tripping, but only for 15 seconds. Duration cannot be overwritten/extended by adamant seed, sorry. Armor S II does not work either.

## Might Pill
The biggest consumable attack buff in the game. This lasts 15 seconds. Eat this and eat a might seed while the pill is still active to extend it to 3 minutes (5 minutes with Lasting Power.) 

## Stat Atk Up and Felyne Specialist stack.
## Sharpness color does not affect Status hits like it does raw and elemental.
## Duping items (legitimately and for great profit!)
This requires two players.

Any item that is lower than RARE4 can be given to another player.

So find the useful consumables in your box and start giving them to a friend! Mega Nutrients, Sonic Bombs, Nets, Flash Bombs, Bomb Casings... there are so many great consumables.

When you're done, quit the game and do not save :)

Make sure the item receiver *does* save. Otherwise, they owe you a coke. I don't make the rules.

## Monster roars double as sonic bombs. Kind of funny when one Diablos roars another out of the ground, for example.

## The time of day of the hunt depends on when the quest was posted, not what the time of day is currently in the tavern! Very rarely do they differ, but it does happen.

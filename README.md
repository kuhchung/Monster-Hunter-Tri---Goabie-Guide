# Monster Hunter Tri - Goabie's Guide
Just an idiot's random musings on Monster Hunter Tri

Hi! I'm playing on the Monster Hunter Tri Server Project as Goabie. This is my guide for new and returning players, of which we do not have enough of. Please join us!

After returning to the game after a whole decade, I found myself relearning things that I had known before. This time, I decided to write them down. Maybe other people can benefit. Or maybe they can tell me I'm full of nonsense. Rage baiting is all the rage these baits.

Let's do this!
